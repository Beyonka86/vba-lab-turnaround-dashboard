# 🧪 Lab Turnaround Dashboard – Excel VBA Project

**Built by Beyonka Powell | Healthcare Data Enthusiast | Lab Professional Turned Data Scientist**

Welcome to a smarter way to track lab efficiency! This project is a real-world simulation of a lab performance dashboard powered by **Excel VBA automation**. It helps monitor test turnaround times, flag SLA violations, and visualize performance trends just like an Epic Beaker Analyst or Healthcare Data Analyst would do in a live environment.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Automatic Turnaround Time Calculation**  
Just enter collection and result times — VBA does the math in hours.

✅ **Late vs On-Time Flagging**  
Tests exceeding a 24-hour SLA are instantly marked as **Late** and highlighted in red.

✅ **Interactive Data Entry Form**  
A custom-built UserForm makes data entry clean, controlled, and professional.

✅ **Dynamic Dashboard with Pivot Charts**  
Easily see:
- Average Turnaround Time by Test Type
- Percentage of On-Time vs Late Tests
- Overall volume of lab activity

✅ **One-Click Buttons**  
Buttons run all macros: update calculations and enter new patient data.
